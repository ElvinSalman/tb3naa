    "content":"The turboval engine TV3-117 is designed for the installation of helicopters. It is one of the world's best engines in its class that is achieved thanks to the high efficiency of the main nodes (compressor efficiency 86%, turbine gum pressure el - 91%, free turbine efficiency - 96%). The amount of specific fuel and mass consumption meets the world's best standards. The engine has a gasodynamic stability. In the design of the engine, the technical solutions of the motor are applied: the Titanium rotor of the compressor, the electron-beam source made of separate discs; working and hot clamping shoulder blades of titanium alloy compressor purchased by cold valsovka method; contact graphite seals of lubricants; electronic-hi drumexanical adjustment and control system is applied on the newest disks, etc.the engine has a large resource, cargo joint reliability, ease, good repair ability. New changes are approved. Experienced modifications are being prepared for Lake Jacques combat helicopters. Some of the changes received various state awards of the USSR and Rusi Yan.TV3-117 is one of the most reliable engines in the world. Over the past 7 years there have been no engine flying failures!
